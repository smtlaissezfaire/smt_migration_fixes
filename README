SMTMigrationFixes
=================

Having problems with your migrations because of outdated column information?
Are you seeing errors like the following?

Mysql::Error: Unknown column 'events.is_temporary' in 'field list': SELECT `events`.`id` ...

By default, ActiveRecord caches the column information. Installing this plugin
will invalidate that cache for each migration run.

Thanks

This plugin is based on a patch to ActiveRecord from
